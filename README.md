# SmurfRP Remote Console Admin Tool
This was used when SmurfRP was at it's primetime. It's a simple remote console
for those who were lazy to get on the server.


# Features
- Login System
- Level Based Account System (Flags for each function, such as remote console access, ban management etc)
- Manage Bans (Add, Delete, Modify)
- Remote Console

# The Login System/Account Level System/Bans Management
These are all MySQL based. No importable .SQL is supplied. You'll have to read the code
and create the database yourself. 

The ban system fetched all bans from ULX Global Ban module. It added/removed/modified bans
at the same time as making remote connection to server and added/removed/modified them there.

# Compiling
No special pre-requisites should be needed. Just open the project file and compile

# What is SmurfRP?
It was the biggest Garry's Mod server in Scandinavia from 2013-2014. A large user database
required ease of access. SmurfRP Remote Admin Tool was created.
